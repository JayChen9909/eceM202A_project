## Abstract  
## Instructions:  

### Hardware: Arduino Nano33 BLE  
### Software: Edge Impulse  
### Before Running:  
1. For Mac：Add ‘arduino-cli’ into your path by following the instruction from https://osxdaily.com/2014/08/14/add-new-path-to-path-command-line/  
2. For Mac: To connect to your Nano33 BLE, following the instruction from https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/development-platforms/officially-supported-mcu-targets/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense  

### Use the folders as follows:

* doc/ for the website contents (report, media).
* software/ for files used for deploying the model on Nano33 BLE board or Arduino Library.
* data/ for the collected motion data from music instruments of Piano, Violin, Drum, and Clarinet.
